Learning Outcomes
=================

.. note::
 1.  Learn how to parallelise Python code using Numba.
 2.  Learn how to use GPUs in Numba. 

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Numba to speed up Python code. Numba is a just-in-time 
compiler that translates Python functions into machine code, which can significantly boost performance
for numerical and scientific tasks. We will cover the basics of applying Numba's features, optimizing
functions, and integrating with libraries like NumPy. By the end, you'll understand how to use Numba
to improve your code's efficiency and performance.
